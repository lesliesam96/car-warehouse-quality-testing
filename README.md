# Car Warehouse Management Web Application

**Software Quality Engineering & Backend Testing Project**

## Overview

This project focuses on **software quality engineering** for a REST-based web application designed to manage a car warehouse.
The application allows users to view, search, add, and delete cars through a frontend interface connected to a backend API.

The main objective of this project was **not feature development**, but to **evaluate, test, and improve the reliability, performance, and robustness** of an existing enterprise-style application using industry-standard testing practices.

---

## Application Scope

The tested application supports the following functionalities:

* View the list of available cars
* View detailed information for a specific car
* Search cars based on criteria
* Add new cars
* Delete existing cars

Frontend and backend were tested independently and together as a complete system.

---

## Project Objectives

* Design a **comprehensive test strategy** covering the full software lifecycle
* Validate functional correctness, performance, security, and data integrity
* Identify defects, analyze root causes, and propose improvements
* Automate tests where possible to improve repeatability and maintainability
* Apply **enterprise-level quality assurance practices**

---

## Testing Strategy

The project includes the following testing layers:

### 1. Unit Testing

* Validated individual backend components and business logic
* Ensured correctness of core functionalities in isolation

**Tools:**

* JUnit
* Mockito
* JaCoCo (code coverage)

---

### 2. Integration Testing

* Verified interactions between backend modules and REST endpoints
* Tested request/response consistency and error handling

**Tools:**

* JUnit
* Postman

---

### 3. System Testing

* Tested end-to-end application behavior from frontend to backend
* Validated user flows and functional scenarios

**Tools:**

* Cypress / Postman (depending on scenario)

---

### 4. Database Testing

* Verified data persistence, integrity, and consistency
* Ensured correct behavior for create, read, update, and delete operations

---

### 5. Security Testing

* Identified vulnerabilities related to input validation and API exposure
* Tested invalid requests and edge cases to assess robustness

---

### 6. Performance & Load Testing

* Evaluated application behavior under load
* Identified performance bottlenecks and scalability issues

**Tools:**

* JMeter

---

## Defect Analysis

* Detected and documented functional, performance, and reliability issues
* Analyzed root causes for each anomaly
* Proposed technical fixes and improvements
* Produced execution reports and summarized test results

---

## Automation

* Developed automated test scripts to improve repeatability
* Reduced manual testing effort and improved regression coverage

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Languages:** Java
* **Backend:** REST APIs
* **Testing:** JUnit, Mockito, JaCoCo, Postman, JMeter, Cypress
* **Build & Dependency Management:** Maven
* **Version Control:** Git / GitHub

---

## Key Takeaways

* Strengthened understanding of **enterprise software quality practices**
* Applied structured testing methodologies used in real-world production environments
* Improved skills in debugging, defect analysis, and test automation
* Developed a strong **software engineering mindset focused on reliability and maintainability**
